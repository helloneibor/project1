                                    <p id="p1">Weight management is the phrase used to describe both the techniques and underlying physiological processes that contribute to a person's ability to attain and maintain a certain weight. Most weight management techniques encompass long-term lifestyle strategies that promote healthy eating and daily physical activity.[1] Moreover, weight management involves developing meaningful ways to track weight over time and to identify ideal body weights for different individuals.[2]
Due to the rising obesity rates in many parts of the world, proper weight management strategies most often focus on achieving healthy weights through slow but steady weight loss, followed by maintenance of an ideal body weight over time.[3]
<br><br>Rising obesity rates are a major concern around the world, especially in North America. About 60% of Americans and Canadians are either overweight or obese.[3][4] Understanding the basic science of weight management and some of the strategies for attaining and maintaining a healthy weight is very important to a person's overall health because obesity is a risk factor for many chronic diseases, like Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.[5]</p>
